# Introduction

The final year capstone project was an android app prototype for a client that provides a real time bus tracking solution (similar to uber/transit app) using beacons. Tech include AWS, Java, Node, Serverless, Firebase Cloud Messaging, and MongoDB.

Please note that the code is not executable as the client has changed the credentials after the project was successfully handed over. it's been reuploaded without the API keys and other credentials for client's best interest. However, an entertaining infomercial of the project can be found here- https://youtu.be/zbZ5gkM8Kvc :)
